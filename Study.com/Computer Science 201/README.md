<p class="introP">This was a very informative class that I had the opportunity to take. It taught me about the essentials of data structures and helped further solidify my grasp on programming with Java. I was able to learn about object-oriented design, algorithms, trees, hashmaps, priority queues, text processing, and memory management.Â 

There are 2 projects that were required for this class. The <a href="https://github.com/jmartell72/SchoolProjects/tree/main/Study.com/Computer%20Science%20201/Project%201">first project</a> was to create a binary search tree that would take a string of numbers in, and then you would be able to search that binary search tree for your value. The <a href="https://github.com/jmartell72/SchoolProjects/tree/main/Study.com/Computer%20Science%20201/Project%202">second project</a> was to search a list of specific states for a certain state based on a part of its name.

These projects and classes really helped me learn the purpose and differences between Binary Search Trees and Hashmaps. I am further continuing to solidify my knowledge in these matters by practicing on <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>.</p>
